                <p>
                    I am an incoming senior at UC San Diego pursuing a major in Computer Engineering. 
                    I am interested in data analysis, software developing, project managing and leadership. 
                    I actively seek ways to challenge myself to develop more relevant industrial experiences 
                    in these fields and use these experiences to enrich my career as a computer engineer and 
                    eventually become a project manager to lead the team. I am driven to influence and inspire 
                    the lives of people around me. I joined student council in both high school and college 
                    to challenge the status quo of the student policies. In college, I helped people in the 
                    local La Jolla community through both Circle K International and Sixth College student 
                    council to make a difference in their life. In my leisure time, I usually work with different 
                    engineering projects and internships. I gained valuable experiences in 3D printers, soldering,
                    board assembly, coding and data analysis. Apart from my technical skills, I love to lift in 
                    the gym because I love to look sharp and fit. In an age where life is dominated by digital 
                    media I believe bringing design to life with code is essential. So, I major in computer 
                    engineering to study both coding in the software part and board design in the hardware part. 
                    During my recent internship with UC medical center, when I am looking at the energy efficiency 
                    of the hospital, I realize there are definite ways to save energy. I will be working on a project 
                    that implements of a data monitor program to bring the visualization of energy usage of each 
                    facility to live. Through computer engineering, I want to enrich my experiences in data 
                    analysis, software developing, project managing and leadership to influence others in a positive way.
